Now that you have finished Learn CF in a Week, you should have a good
understanding of ColdFusion. While you might not be ready to go out and
lead a team of developers in building a highly complex and scalable
application, you should feel confident enough in creating a few basic
applications while you get your feet wet.

If you have been following along with the Hands On chapters, you should
also have a completed web site. If you do not already have a personal
web site, feel free to find some hosting and launch the web site. Having
a personal website is a great way of advertising and showcasing your
skills to others.

With the completion of this course, you are probably wondering what you
should do next. There are a few things that you can do to help improve
your ColdFusion knowledge:

found a good solution. Here are a few useful resources:

Get Certified

Besides building some fantastic applications, one way to demonstrate to
people how great your ColdFusion knowledge is to get ColdFusion
Certified. Adobe offers a ColdFusion certification test that anyone can
take. There is a fee involved, but once passed, you will have the
ability to call yourself an Adobe Certified Expert (ACE). Not only is
this a great thing to show your employer or future employer, but you
also get to display a special logo on your web site!
